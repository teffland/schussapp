schussapp
=========

The schuss app is a custom database interface application designed for the Schussmeisters Ski Club Inc. - a small not-for-profit in Buffalo, NY that provides affordable skiing to affiliates of colleges in Western New York.

It serves 3 major roles:

1)  Store yearly customer data in backend MySQLDB.

2)  Provide office staff with simple interface for entering/managing customer data.

3)  Facilitate improvements in office procedures by keeping standardized data and providing the data in consumable format for the office board to make informed decisions.

Since Schussmeisters Ski Club has a very unique product, business model, and style of service, the app is also unique in its data models and interface design.
